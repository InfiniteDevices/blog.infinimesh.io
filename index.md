### Public Cloud lock-in 

Lyft pays 8M/month for AWS services, and plan to spend 300M till 2021. Even when Lyft doesn't match the numbers they have to pay the full amount - a deep lock-in, according to different media coverages.

We as founder of infinimesh.io has this experience over years in our past experiences. We decided to build a complete new IoT solution as truly cloud native, avoiding patent and infrastructure lock-in using and invent the newest software tech. The goal is simple, companies and business should not depend on 3rd parties toolsets, clouds or providers. 

What makes infinimesh.io different? Using kubernetes as infrastructure layer, kafka as topic layer, graph as permission layer and a fully transparent, easy to use API. Written in #Go and using lightweight JS components as UI layer the software stack runs everywhere.And since we wrote our own MQTT broker we are able to make MQTT endpoints transparent, so that a move from a cloud to another one doesn't affect the device fleet. #IoT and #IIoT changes the world, generates more data and does not need to suffer from complex systems, lock-ins or toolsets. This is our vision.
